## Guiding Principle: Keep it Simple

Our goal is to create clear, practical guides that are easy to use and easy to create. We favor simplicity over complexity.

## File and Naming Convention

To keep the repository consistent and easy to navigate, please follow this simple convention:

*   **One System, One File:** All information for a single system model should be contained within a single file named `README.md`.
*   **Folder Structure:** This file should be placed in a folder named after the manufacturer and model. For example: `/systems/gilgen/neste-3/README.md`.

GitHub will automatically display this `README.md` file when anyone browses to that folder, making it easy to find and read.

## How to Add a New System Guide

1.  **Check for an existing guide:** First, ensure you're not duplicating work by checking the `/systems` directory.
2.  **Create the folder structure:** For example, to add a guide for a "Dorma ES200," you would create the path `/systems/dormakaba/es200/`.
3.  **Create your `README.md` file:** Inside the new folder, create a single file named `README.md`.
4.  **Fill it out using the template:** Copy the content from **[`TEMPLATE.md`](./TEMPLATE.md)** into your new `README.md` and fill it out with your knowledge.
5.  **Use your own diagrams:** Clear visuals are incredibly helpful. Add them to the same folder and link them in your document.
6.  **Submit a Pull Request!** Fork the repository and submit a Pull Request with your new guide. We'll review it and get it merged.

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Do not add original wiring diagrams, manuals, or any other copyrighted documents directly from manufacturers.** Instead, create your own diagrams, redraw them based on publicly available information, or describe the connections in text. We want to avoid any potential copyright issues.

We look forward to your contributions!
