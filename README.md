# Open Building Integrations

A public, community-driven knowledge base for integrating physical building systems.

</div>

## The Vision

Ever struggled to find clear, public documentation for integrating a specific door controller, sensor, or other building system? So have we. This project was created to solve that problem.

Our goal is to build a collection of practical guides to empower installers, integrators, and developers. We believe this knowledge shouldn't be locked away in difficult-to-access portals.

This repository is for you if you need to:
*   Connect a third-party door system to a custom access control platform.
*   Control a sliding door with a simple IoT device like a Shelly.
*   Understand the wiring for a specific building system model.
*   Share your own expertise with the community.

## How to Find Information

All documentation is organized by the system manufacturer. You can browse the guides directly in the [`/systems`](./systems) folder.

*   **/systems/[manufacturer]/[model]/** */: Contains detailed guides for specific models.

## How to Contribute

This project thrives on community contributions. If you have experience with a system that isn't documented here, or if you spot an error, we welcome your help!
